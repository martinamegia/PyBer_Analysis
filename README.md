Summary
After addressing the disparities among city types, these are my 3 recommendations. 
1. There is an adequate ratio between total rides and total drivers in the rural and suburban area. Maintaining this ratio will continue to maintain efficiency and reasonable workload for each driver. 
2. The urban area has significantly more drivers than riders. This has lessened the average fare per driver and can be unfair to them as employees as they can earn more in the suburban and rural area. It is unfair as the cost of living may be higher in urban areas. My recommendation is to promote the ride sharing app in order to accumulate more riders/customers and increase the rate for each ride to keep drivers committed. 
3. It is best for the company to focus more on the urban areas as this is where they get more customers yet the drivers in this area are earning the lowest.
